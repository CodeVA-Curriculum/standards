  title: PS.1
  text: The student will demonstrate an understanding of scientific and engineering practices by
  subs: 
    - asking questions and defining problems (ask questions that require empirical evidence to answer, develop hypotheses indicating relationships between independent and dependent variables, offer simple solutions to design problems)
    - planning and carrying out investigations (independently and collaboratively plan and conduct observational and experimental investigations; identify variables, constants, and controls where appropriate and include the safe use of chemicals and equipment, evaluate the accuracy of various methods for collecting data, take metric measurements using appropriate tools and technologies, apply scientific ideas or principles to design, construct, and/or test a design of an object, tool, process or system)
    - interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating data (construct and interpret data tables showing independent and dependentvariables, repeated trials, and means, construct, analyze, and interpret graphical displays of data and considerlimitations of data analysis, apply mathematical concepts and processes to scientific questions, use data to evaluate and refine design solutions to best meet criteria)
    - constructing and critiquing conclusions and explanations (construct scientific explanations based on valid and reliable evidence obtained from sources (including the students’ own investigations), construct arguments supported by empirical evidence and scientific reasoning, generate and compare multiple solutions to problems based on how wellthey meet the criteria and constraints, differentiate between a scientific hypothesis, theory, and law)
    - developing and using models (construct, develop, and use models and simulations to illustrate and/or explain observable and unobservable phenomena, evaluate limitations of models)
    - obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information (read scientific texts, including those adapted for classroom use, to determine the central idea and/or obtain scientific and/or technical information, gather, read, and synthesize information from multiple appropriate sources and assess the credibility, accuracy, and possible bias of each publication, construct, use, and/or present an oral and written argument supported by empirical evidence and scientific reasoning)
