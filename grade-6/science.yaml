  title: 6.1
  text: The student will demonstrate an understanding of scientific and engineering practices by
  subs: 
    - asking questions and defining problems (ask questions to determine relationships between independent and dependent variables, develop hypotheses and identify independent and dependent variables, offer simple solutions to design problems)
    - planning and carrying out investigations (independently and collaboratively plan and conduct observational and experimental investigations; identify variables, constants, and controls where appropriate, and include the safe use of chemicals and equipment, evaluate the accuracy of various methods for collecting data, take metric measurements using appropriate tools, use tools and materials to design and/or build a device to solve a specific problem)
    - interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating data (organize data sets to reveal patterns that suggest relationships, construct, analyze, and interpret graphical displays of data, compare and contrast data collected by different groups and discuss similarities and differences in findings, use data to evaluate and refine design solutions)
    - constructing and critiquing conclusions and explanations (construct explanations that includes qualitative or quantitative relationships between variables, construct scientific explanations based on valid and reliable evidence obtained from sources (including the students’ own investigations), generate and compare multiple solutions to problems based on how well they meet the criteria and constraints)
    - developing and using models (use scale models to represent and estimate distance,  use, develop, and revise models to predict and explain phenomena, evaluate limitations of models)
    - obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information (read scientific texts, including those adapted for classroom use, to obtain scientific and/or technical information, gather, read, and synthesize information from multiple appropriate sources and assess the credibility, accuracy, and possible bias of each publication, construct, use, and/or present an argument supported by empirical evidence and scientific reasoning)
