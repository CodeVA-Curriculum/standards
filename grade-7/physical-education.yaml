      - Describe and demonstrate how movement is stabilized, including balance (center of gravity and center of support) and planes of motion.
      - Demonstrate the progression of learning (practice, self or peer assess, correct, practice at a higher level, and reassess) for a specific skill or movement. 

  - id: 7.PE.AM.2
    title: 7.2
    text: The student will understand and apply movement principles and concepts and knowledge of major body structures.
    subs: 
      - Identify the “core muscles,” including pelvic, lower back, hips, gluteal muscles, and abdomen, and explain their role in stabilizing movement.
      - Apply biomechanical principles (e.g., center of gravity, base of support) to understand and perform skillful movements. 
      - Describe the anatomical planes of motion in which movement occurs, including sagittal plane, frontal plane, and transverse plane.
      - Analyze skill patterns and movement performance of self and others, detecting and correcting mechanical errors for selected movements.
      - Apply knowledge of anatomy and joint types to accurately describe skill- and fitness-based movements, such as throwing/catching, striking, lunges, and push-ups.

  - id: 7.PE.FP.3
    title: 7.3
    text: The student will apply concepts and principles of training and fitness-planning skills to improve physical fitness.
    subs:
      - Identify safe practices for improving physical fitness.
      - Complete a self-assessment of health-related fitness and develop a comprehensive personal fitness plan, including SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely) goals, an action plan that incorporates the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise) principle and to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, timeline, documentation of activities inside and outside school, roadblocks/barriers and solutions, midyear and end-of-year assessments, and reflection on progress for improving at least two self-selected components of health-related fitness.
      - Identify and apply concepts of fitness improvement using various resources, including available technology, to evaluate, monitor, and record activities for a fitness plan.
      - Calculate resting, activity, and recovery heart rate and describe its relationship to aerobic fitness.
      - Describe the differences between aerobic and anaerobic activities and provide three examples of each.
      - Explain the role of perseverance in achieving fitness goals.

  - id: 7.PE.SE.4
    title: 7.4
    text: The student will demonstrate and apply skills to work independently and with others in physical activity settings.
    subs: 
      - Apply safety procedures, rules, and appropriate etiquette in physical activity settings by self-officiating modified physical activities/games.
      - Create guidelines and demonstrate how to solve problems and resolve conflicts in activity settings.
      - Explain the importance of cooperating with classmates, and demonstrate supportive behaviors that promote feelings of inclusion and safety of others.
      - Describe and demonstrate strategies for dealing with stress, such as deep breathing, guided visualization, and aerobic exercise.
      - Demonstrate effective communication skills by providing feedback to a peer, using appropriate tone, and other communication skills.
      - Identify positive mental and emotional aspects of participating in a variety of physical activities. 
      - Describe how participation in physical activities creates enjoyment, reduces stress, and improves mental and emotional wellness. 
      - Identify specific safety concerns associated with at least one activity that includes rules, equipment, and etiquette.
      - Identify and describe instances that do not support feelings of inclusion (e.g., marginalization).

  - id: 7.PE.EB.5
    title: 7.5
    text: The student will describe rate of perceived exertion and nutrients (energy) needed for a variety of activities and explain the importance of sleep for energy balance.
    subs:
      - Explain the connection between an RPE scale and heart rate and the body’s response to physical activity.
      - Define and describe the anaerobic and aerobic energy systems.
      - Identify the nutrients needed for optimal aerobic and anaerobic capacity and for muscle strength and endurance.
      - Calculate resting heart rate (RHR) and describe its relationship to aerobic fitness and an RPE scale.
      - Explain the effects of sleep on energy balance.
