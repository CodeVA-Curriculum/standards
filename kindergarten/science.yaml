  text: The student will demonstrate an understanding of scientific and engineering practices by...
  subs: 
    - asking questions and defining problems (ask questions based on observations, identify a problem based on need, make predictions based on observations)
    - planning and carrying out investigations (make observations to collect data, identify characteristics and properties of objects through observations, measure the relative length and weight of common objects, record information from investigations)
    - interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating data (describe patterns, classify and/or sequence objects based on a single physical characteristic or property, organize and represent data, read and interpret data in object graphs, picture graphs, and tables)
    - constructing and critiquing conclusions and explanations (make simple conclusions based on data or observations)
    - developing and using models (distinguish between a model and an actual object)
    - obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information (communicate comparative measures, e.g., heavier, lighter, longer, shorter, more, less, hotter, colder; communicate observations using pictures, drawings, and/or speech)
