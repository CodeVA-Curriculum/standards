  text: The student will demonstrate an understanding of scientific and engineering practices by...
  subs: 
    - asking questions and defining problems (ask questions to determine relationships between independent and dependent variables, develop hypotheses and identify independent and dependent variables, offer simple solutions to design problems)
    - planning and carrying out investigations (cindependently and collaboratively plan and conduct observational and experimental investigations; identify variables, constants, and controls where appropriate, and include the safe use of chemicals and equipment, evaluate the accuracy of various methods for collecting data, take metric measurements using appropriate tools, use tools and materials to design and/or build a device to solve a specific problem)
    - interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating data (rorganize data sets to reveal patterns that suggest relationships, construct, analyze, and interpret graphical displays of data, compare and contrast data collected by different groups and discuss similarities and differences in findings, use data to evaluate and refine design solutions)
    - constructing and critiquing conclusions and explanations (construct explanations that includes qualitative or quantitative relationships between variables, construct scientific explanations based on valid and reliable evidence obtained from sources (including the students’ own investigations), generate and compare multiple solutions to problems based on how well they meet the criteria and constraints)
    - developing and using models (use scale models to represent and estimate distance, use, develop, and revise models to predict and explain phenomena, evaluate limitations of models)
    - obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information (read scientific texts, including those adapted for classroom use, to obtain scientific and/or technical information, gather, read, and synthesize information from multiple appropriate sources and assess the credibility, accuracy, and possible bias of each publication, construct, use, and/or present an argument supported by empirical evidence and scientific reasoning)

  text: The student will investigate and understand that the solar system is organized and the various bodies in the solar system interact. Key ideas include
  subs: 
    - matter is distributed throughout the solar system;
    - planets have different sizes and orbit at different distances from the sun;
    - gravity contributes to orbital motion; and
    - the understanding of the solar system has developed over time.

  title: 5.3
  text: The student will investigate and understand that there is a relationship between force and energy of moving objects. Key ideas include
  subs: 
    - moving objects have kinetic energy;
    - motion is described by an object’s direction and speed;
    - changes in motion are related to net force and mass;
    - when objects collide, the contact forces transfer energy and can change objects’ motion; and 
    - friction is a force that opposes motion.

  title: 5.4
  text: The student will investigate and understand that electricity is transmitted and used in daily life. Key ideas include
  subs: 
  - electricity flows easily through conductors but not insulators;
  - electricity flows through closed circuits;
  - static electricity can be generated by rubbing certain materials together;
  - electrical energy can be transformed into radiant, mechanical, and thermal energy; and
  - a current flowing through a wire creates a magnetic field.

  title: 5.5
  text: The student will investigate and understand that sound can be produced and transmitted. Key ideas include
  subs: 
  - sound is produced when an object or substance vibrates;
  - sound is the transfer of energy;
  - different media transmit sound differently; and 
  - sound waves have many uses and applications.

  title: 5.6
  text: The student will investigate and understand that visible light has certain characteristics and behaves in predictable ways. Key ideas include
  subs: 
    - visible light is radiant energy that moves in transverse waves;
    - the visible spectrum includes light with different wavelengths;
    - matter influences the path of light; and
    - radiant energy can be transformed into thermal, mechanical, and electrical energy.

  title: 5.7
  text: The student will investigate and understand that matter has properties and interactions. Key ideas include
  subs: 
    - matter is composed of atoms;
    - substances can be mixed together without changes in their physical properties; and
    - energy has an effect on the phases of matter.

  title: 5.8
  text: The student will investigate and understand that Earth constantly changes. Key ideas include
  subs: 
    - Earth’s internal energy causes movement of material within the Earth;
    - plate tectonics describe movement of the crust; 
    - the rock cycle models the transformation of rocks;
    - processes such as weathering, erosion, and deposition change the surface of the Earth; and
    - fossils and geologic patterns provide evidence of Earth’s change.

  title: 5.9
  text: The student will investigate and understand that the conservation of energy resources is important. Key ideas include
  subs: 
    - some sources of energy are considered renewable and others are not;
    - individuals and communities have means of conserving both energy and matter; and
    - advances in technology improve the ability to transfer and transform energy.
