    title: 1.1
    text: The student will demonstrate developmentally appropriate form and at least two correct critical elements (i.e., small, isolated parts of the whole skill or movement) of locomotor, non-locomotor, and manipulative skills.
    subs:
      - Demonstrate critical elements used and distinguish between walking, jogging, running, galloping, leaping, skipping, and sliding.
      - Demonstrate non-locomotor skills of twisting, curling, bending, stretching, and balancing on different body parts. 
      - Demonstrate forward, sideways, backward (slow), and side-to-side movement.
      - Demonstrate jogging, running, skipping, galloping, sliding, and leaping using pathways (straight, curving, and zigzagging) and speeds (fast, slow, and moderate).
      - Demonstrate simple educational gymnastic skills, including balancing at different levels, two different rolls (narrow or curled), moving in two different directions, and transfer of weight.
      - Demonstrate developmentally appropriate form with at least two critical elements used in eye-hand coordination skills while stationary and moving (e.g., dribbling a ball with the hand, underhand tossing and catching a ball/beanbag to self and with a partner, throwing and rolling underhand to targets, volleying a balloon upward with various body parts, volleying a balloon in the air with a short implement or noodle, striking a stationary object with the hand or with a short-handled implement or noodle.)
      - Demonstrate developmentally appropriate form with at least two critical elements used in eye-foot coordination skills (e.g., dribbling a ball, kicking a moving or stationary ball to a target.)
      - Perform a teacher-led rhythmic pattern or dance in personal space and general space.
      - Demonstrate consecutive jumps (more than one) with a short rope (self-turn), long rope (student-turn), and forward, backward, zigzag, hopping, and leaping over a stationary rope.

    title: 1.2
    text: The student will identify basic anatomical structures and basic spatial awareness concepts.
    subs:
      - Identify where the brain is located.
      - Explain that muscles attach to bones to help the body move.
      - Describe how the heart and lungs work together to keep the body moving.
      - Explain that the heart is a muscle that grows stronger with movement. 
      - Demonstrate the appropriate use of personal and general space.

  - id: 1.PE.FP.3
    title: 1.3
    text: The student will identify changes in the body that occur during moderate to vigorous physical activity. 
    subs:
      - Identify physical activities to do at home, individually and with others, to help the body move and grow.
      - Identify one cardiorespiratory activity that increases heart and breathing rates to make the heart stronger.
      - Identify and demonstrate physical activity at two or more intensity levels that increase heart rate and breathing.

  - id: 1.PE.SE.4
    title: 1.4
    text: The student will demonstrate basic knowledge and skills for safe and cooperative play, individually and with others, without reminders from the teacher.
    subs:
      - Work cooperatively with peers and demonstrate safe equipment use when working individually or with peers.
      - Demonstrate safety rules for physical activities.
      - Demonstrate the safe and respectful use of space. 
      - Participate in developing classroom (procedural) rules that promote relationship skills and support a positive and safe learning environment during physical activity.
      - Demonstrate the use of self-management skills to control emotions during physical activity.
      - Explain that physical activity helps improve mood and brain function for learning.
      - Participate in activities that are constructed to support inclusion.

  - id: 1.PE.EB.5
    title: 1.5
    text: The student will identify basic nutrition concepts of energy balance.
    subs: 
      - Name the food groups as identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
      - Name one food from each (USDA) food group. 
      - Explain why the body needs water.
      - Explain that food provides energy for physical activity.
