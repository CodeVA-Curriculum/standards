    text: The student will demonstrate all critical elements in movement forms in various activities and demonstrate the six components of skill-related fitness.
    subs:
      - Combine and apply manipulative skills into small-sided games for overhand and underhand throwing and catching, throwing and catching to a target with accuracy and control, and hand and/or foot dribbling with accuracy at varying speeds while applying spatial awareness within partner and small-group modified game-play.
      - Combine and apply the manipulative skills of volleying with a partner over a net or against a wall with changes in force, accuracy, and direction into small-sided games.
      - Combine and apply the manipulative skills of striking/batting an object with a short and long implement with changes in force, accuracy, direction in small-sided games.
      - Combine and apply manipulative skills in small-sided games, dribbling/passing a soccer ball with accuracy at varying speeds while applying spatial awareness to a partner or within a small group.
      - Create and perform a movement sequence in a jump rope or dance activity. 
      - Demonstrate and apply the six components of skill-related fitness (i.e., agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed).
      - Demonstrate basic offensive and defensive strategies in noncomplex, modified, and small-sided activities.

    title: 6.2
    text: The student will apply both movement principles and concepts including the knowledge of anatomical structures to movement-skill performance.
    subs: 
      - Refine and adapt individual and group activity skills by applying concepts of relationships, effort, spatial awareness, direction, speed, accuracy, and pathways to improve performance.

  - id: 6.PE.FP.3
    title: 6.3
    text: The student will apply skills of measurement, analysis, goal setting, problem solving, and decision making to improve or maintain physical fitness.
    subs: 
      - Create a basic personal fitness plan for at least one health-related component of fitness, including baseline fitness data, a SMART goal, activities that will address the goal, a log of activities inside and outside school, reassessment data (post-data) and reflection of goal progress/attainment.
      - Identify a variety of resources, including available technology to evaluate, monitor, and record activities for fitness improvement.
      - Calculate resting, active, and recovery heart rate during a variety of physical activities, and identify the relationship between heart rate and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) levels.
      - Describe how being physically active improves physical and mental health. 
      - Interpret fitness data, comparing individual scores to health-related criterion-referenced standards (Virginia wellness-related fitness standards, FitnessGram®, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines).
      - Create and implement an activity plan to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and identify the necessary safety precautions for participation.
      - Describe a rate of perceived exertion scale.

  - id: 6.PE.SE.4
    title: 6.4
    text: The student will demonstrate and apply skills of communication, conflict resolution, and cooperation to achieve individual and group goals that apply to working independently and with others in physical activity settings.
    subs:
      - Demonstrate effective communication and creative thinking skills to solve problems, make decisions and resolve conflict with others, and promote safe participation in physical activities.
      - Compare and critique rules, safety procedures, and etiquette for two different physical activities.
      - Develop an improvement plan for a self-selected physical activity, discuss the challenges faced, and reflect on how these challenges were overcome.
      - Describe the benefits of competitive and noncompetitive physical activities.
      - Demonstrate integrity and apply rules/etiquette for a team-building activity.
      - Participate in developing student-led classroom activities that promote feelings of inclusion, which support feelings of acceptance, belonging, and being valued, for all students.

  - id: 6.PE.EB.5
    title: 6.5
    text: The student will explain the relationship between energy balance and nutrition guidelines, meal planning, and exercise intensity.
    subs:
      - Create a one-day meal and snack plan based on Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), portions, hydration, and sugar.
      - Describe the relationship between resting heart rate and exercise intensity.
      - Explain the effects of physical activity guidelines on energy expenditure.
