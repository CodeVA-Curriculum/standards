    subs: 
      - Demonstrate and apply movement forms to a variety of cooperative and tactical activities that include dynamic and unpredictable situations with a focus on defensive strategies, including reducing space, transitioning from offense to defense quickly, and selecting appropriate tactics to gain a defensive advantage.
      - Create a rhythmic movement or dance sequence to music as an individual or in a group. 
      - Demonstrate skill-related components of fitness (agility, balance, coordination, power, reaction time, and speed) specific to various activities. 
      - Demonstrate and explain the role of balance (center of support, center of gravity, and planes of motion) in a variety of activities.
      - Demonstrate physiological principles of warm-up, cool down, overload, specificity, and progression to improve performance.
      - Demonstrate the use of technology tools to analyze and improve performance.
      - Analyze movement performance/progressions (i.e., practice, self or peer assess, correct, practice at a higher level, and reassess) of a specific skill and use feedback to learn or improve the movement skills of self and others

    title: 8.2
    text: The student will apply movement principles and concepts and apply knowledge of major body structures to explain how body systems interact with and respond to physical activity and movement.
    subs: 
      - Explain how body systems interact with one another during physical activity. 
      - Identify and describe biomechanical principles (e.g., spin, rebound, effects of levers, force, motion, rotation, and energy) to understand skillful movements.
      - Explain how offensive and defensive tactics and strategies are used to gain an advantage in games and sports.
      - Analyze performance in a variety of selected skills/activities using movement concepts of agility, power, coordination, reaction time, speed, force, motion, rotation, and energy of self and partner.
      - Analyze movement progressions (i.e., practice, self or peer assess, correct, practice at a higher level, and reassess) of a specific skill and use feedback to improve the movement skills of self and/or others.
      - Describe the effects of physical activity and exercise on the body, including cardiorespiratory, muscular, and nervous systems.
      - Apply knowledge of anatomy to accurately describe movements in relation to type of joint and associated movement/motion, associated bones and muscles, and type of muscle contraction.

    title: 8.3
    text: The student will apply self-assessment skills and use technology to create and implement a personal fitness plan to improve or maintain personal fitness.
    subs: 
      - Complete a self-assessment of current fitness levels and develop a comprehensive personal fitness plan, including SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely) goals, an action plan that incorporates the FITT (frequency, intensity, time and type of exercise) principle, a timeline, documentation of activities inside and outside of school, roadblocks/barriers and solutions, midyear and end-of-year assessments, and reflection on progress for improving at least three components of health-related fitness.
      - Describe how an RPE scale can be used to adjust workout intensity during physical activity.
      - Use a variety of resources, including available technology tools and prior fitness data, to evaluate, monitor, and record activities for personal fitness improvement.
      - Create and implement an activity plan (that includes warm-up, cool-down, and appropriate intensity levels) applying specificity, overload, progression, and identify safety precautions to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.
      - Describe the body’s physiological responses to warm-ups and cool downs. 
      - Identify activities that use the anaerobic and aerobic energy systems.
      - Demonstrate perseverance in achieving fitness goals.

  - id: 8.PE.SE.4
    title: 8.4
    text: The student will describe and apply social and safety skills to achieve individual and group goals in physical activity settings.
    subs:
      - Describe and demonstrate best practices for participating safely in physical activity, exercise, and dance (e.g., injury prevention, proper alignment, hydration, use of equipment, implementation of rules, sun protection). 
      - Describe and demonstrate appropriate encouragement and feedback to peers without prompting from the teacher.
      - Identify and demonstrate proper etiquette, respect for others, integrity, effective communication, problem-solving skills, conflict-resolution skills, self-management and teamwork skills while engaging in cooperative and dynamic physical activity and/or social dance.
      - Identify and demonstrate self-awareness in selecting stress-reducing activities (e.g., yoga, Pilates, tai chi).
      - Apply relationship skills and strategies (e.g., trust, compassion, empathy) that promote team/group dynamics and inclusion.
      - Analyze the proper use of equipment and self-management skills in relation to safety in physical activity.
      - Analyze and compare social and emotional benefits of participation in a variety of activities.
      - Identify opportunities for social interaction through physical activity in the community. 
      - Develop plans to enhance inclusion and reduce social exclusion/marginalization.
