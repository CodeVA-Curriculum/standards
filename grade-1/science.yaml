  subs: 
    - asking questions and defining problems (ask questions and make predictions based on observations, identify a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new tool or improved object)
    - planning and carrying out investigations (with guidance, conduct investigations to produce data, identify characteristics and properties of objects by observations, use tools to measure relative length, weight, volume, and temperature of common objects)
    - interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating data (use and share pictures, drawings, and/or writings of observations, describe patterns and relationships, classify and arrange objects based on a single physical characteristic or property, organize and represent various forms of data using tables, picture graphs, and object graphs, read and interpret data displayed in tables, picture graphs, and object graphs, using the vocabulary more, less, fewer, greater than, less than, and equal to)
    - constructing and critiquing conclusions and explanations (make simple conclusions based on data or observations, recognize unusual or unexpected results)
    - developing and using models (use physical models to demonstrate simple phenomena and natural processes)
    - obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information (communicate observations and data using simple graphs, pictures, drawings, numbers, speech and/or writing)
