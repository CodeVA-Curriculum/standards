    title: 4.1
    text: The student will refine movement skills and demonstrate the ability to combine them in increasingly complex movement environments/activities.
    subs:
      - Demonstrate progression toward the use of all critical elements for specialized locomotor, non-locomotor, and manipulative skill combinations in small-sided games, modified sports activities, and lifetime activities, including overhand and underhand throwing and catching with a partner while moving to open spaces, overhand and underhand throwing to a target for distance, dribbling with non-dominant/non-preferred hand while walking at various speeds to open spaces, underhand volleying, catching thrown objects, striking a ball with short and long implement with force and control, and underhand volleying/striking, dribbling and passing a soccer ball with varying speed while moving to open spaces with control.
      - Create and perform an educational gymnastic sequence that combines four or more of the following movement: traveling, balancing, rolling, and other types of weight transfer with smooth transitions from one movement to the other.
      - Create and perform a routine to music that has smooth transitions with an apparent beginning, middle, and end, and integrate shapes, levels, pathways, and locomotor patterns. 
      - Perform a jump rope routine/challenge (e.g., self-turn, long rope, jump bands).
      - Demonstrate the use of pacing, speed, and endurance in a variety of activities.

    title: 4.2
    text: The student will identify major structures and begin to apply knowledge of anatomy to explain movement patterns.
    subs:
      - Identify the major components of the cardiorespiratory system and describe the relationship between the heart, lungs, and blood vessels.
      - Identify the major muscle groups, including the deltoid and gluteal.
      - Identify the major components of the skeletal system, including the sternum, vertebrae, patellae, and phalanges.
      - Locate the radial and/or carotid pulse.
      - Identify the bones and muscles needed to perform one fitness activity and one skilled movement. 
      - Apply the concept of closing space during movement sequences.

    title: 4.3
    text: The student will apply knowledge of health-related fitness, gather and analyze data, and set measurable goals to improve fitness levels.
    subs:
      - Describe the components of health-related fitness (i.e., cardiorespiratory endurance/aerobic capacity, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, body composition) and list at least three physical activities associated with each component.
      - Analyze personal baseline data using data from a standardized health-related criterion-referenced test (e.g., Virginia wellness-related criterion-referenced fitness standards).
      - Create a SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely) goal for at least one health-related component of fitness to improve or maintain fitness level.
      - Identify two physical activities that can be done at school and two physical activities that can be done at home to meet fitness goals.
      - Analyze post-fitness testing results and reflect on goal progress/attainment.
      - Define the FITT (frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise) principles.
      - Calculate resting and activity heart rate during a variety of physical activities.

  - id: 4.PE.SE.4
    title: 4.4
    text: The student will demonstrate positive interactions with others in cooperative and competitive physical activities.
    subs:
      - Identify a group goal and the strategies needed for successful completion while working productively and respectfully with others.
      - Identify and demonstrate conflict-resolution strategies for positive solutions in resolving disagreements in physical activity settings.
      - Define etiquette and demonstrate appropriate behavior when participating in physical activity settings as well as application of rules and procedures.
      - Define integrity and describe its importance in a physical activity setting. 
      - Identify how participation in physical activity improves mood and positively impacts the brain. 
      - Differentiate and communicate about activities that facilitate feelings of inclusion and those that do not.

  - id: 4.PE.EB.5
    title: 4.5
    text: The student will explain the nutrition and activity components of energy balance.
    subs:
      - Define calorie and identify the number of calories per gram of fat (nine), protein (four), and carbohydrates (four).
      - Explain the uses of salt and sugar and the harm of excessive salt and sugar intake.
      - Identify examples of each macronutrient (i.e., fat, protein, carbohydrates).
      - Calculate the calories per gram of macronutrients for various foods.
      - Explain the importance of hydration.
      - Compare and contrast a variety of different hydration choices.
      - Explain the role of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) for energy balance.
      - Identify different portion sizes for each food group.
